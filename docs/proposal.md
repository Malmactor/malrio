### Summary

### Algorithms

For Actor (Mario): CNN as encoder -> attention mapping -> RNN reasoning as decoder -> action to perform

For Level/Map Generator: GAN, Generator - Use CNN to generate the map from noise, Discriminator - Determine difficulty of the map, with average score of the actor

For Training: First, actor and generator are trained seperately in a supervised fasion. Later, actor and generator are trained in turn against each other to achieve the best result.
