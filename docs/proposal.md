### Summary
TODO

### Algorithms

#### For Actor (Mario)
 - CNN as encoder -> 
 - attention mapping -> 
 - RNN reasoning as decoder ->
 - action to perform
 
#### For Level/Map Generator
 - Generative adversarial networks
 - G: Use CNN to generate the map from noise
 - A: Determine difficulty of the map, with average score of the actor

#### For Training
 - First, actor and generator are trained seperately in a supervised fasion.
 - Later, actor and generator are trained in turn against each other to achieve the best result.<br>
